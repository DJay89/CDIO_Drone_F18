This project is developed by students as part of course 62410 @ DTU.
The project is an Intellij project which requires you to add OpenCV 3.4 to your Intellij project.

Download the OpenCV library from https://opencv.org/opencv-3-4.html

WINDOWS: add the OpenCV.jar as a library in:
File > Project Structure > Library > Add > Click on the Library > Add Native path > Apply & Ok.

Linux:
Follow the guide for linux on this website,and compile opencv with cmake.

http://opencv-java-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01-installing-opencv-for-java.html

After compiling opencv with cmake, you should have a build directory. In here you find the
$library$ in /path/to/opencv-X.X.X/build/bin/opencv-XXX.jar
the $sources$ is in /path/to/opencv-X.X.X/build/lib/libopencv_javaXXX.so

add the OpenCV.jar as a library in:
File > Project Structure > Library > Add > locate $library$ and Click on it >
Add Native path > locate $sources$ and Click on it > Apply & Ok.


The remaining libraries can be added from the libs folder insite the project.
